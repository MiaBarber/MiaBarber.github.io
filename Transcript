Hello, I am Mia Aliyah Barber from the little town of Magee, Mississippi. I am the 18 year old daughter of Pastor Willie and First Lady Vanessa Barber. In high school, I was a high honor student and graduated in the top of my class. I played a great variety of sports and was very well known. Ever since I was a child , my dream was to go to places like Africa , Asia, and even Europe. With that being said, later on in my life I plan to be a missionary doctor . I would like to travel the world doctoring and doing the absolute unspeakable while at the same time spreading the word of God. To help pursue my dreams, I will be attending college at Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama on an academic scholarship.
